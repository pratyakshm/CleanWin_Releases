## Release notes
- GUI uses Windows Forms at its core, which is deprecated tech. Hence, **GUI variant enters Servicing channel starting this release**. In short, this means that GUI variant will no longer be updated apart unless it needs bug fixes. Hence, users are strongly recommended to switch to CLI variant for a better and updated experience. 😊
- As I announce the starting of Servicing channel for GUI variant, I am also looking forward to update GUI to a newer technology (NOT WPF) in a not-so-near future. Suggest your ideas, [take a peek here](https://github.com/pratyakshm/CleanWin/discussions/19). 😃
- Some personal stuff: I'm currently in high school, and by the end of July this year, my final exams will begin. The months that follow will be an academically important period in my life. Hence, I might be unable to regularly update CleanWin for during that time. I'm sorry for any inconvenience that might be caused due to this, and I appreciate your patience. Wish me luck! 😁


I hope you too love this release of CleanWin as much as I do! ❤️ Stay home and stay safe! 💕
